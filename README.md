 Problem Statement:
 As ECE Labs at IIITD nurture students working on various Arduino based projects
 involving a vast range of sensors, as a result, some sensors might get damaged.
 This leads to a problem for the Lab Assistants to segregate the sensors which
 have been damaged and are no longer working as expected. This process of
 setting up each sensor with an arduino and testing it is tedious and eats a lot of
 their precious time. As a result, they were searching for a plug-and-play sensor
 testing kit to save time.
 Our Solution:
 The device correctly solves the problem of the sensor testing process being time
 consuming. It is a plug and play solution where the user can connect the sensor
 with some jumper wires, and the device will inform the user about the working
 state of the sensor. Internally, the device runs a code to test that particular
 sensor.
 About the device :
 This device can to used to measure whether the following sensors are working
 correctly. The sensors include:
 Bluetooth HC05
 Current ACS712
 DHT11 Temp and Humidity
 Force FSR402
 Gas MQ135
 IR
 Gyro & Accelerometer MPU6050
 PIR
 Soil Moisture
 Ultrasonic
Schematic:
 Getting Started:
 1 Powerthe device with a 912V DC Adapter and turn the power switch on to
 see the Green Power LED glowing.
 2 TheLCDdisplay will display a Welcome message, followed by the list of
 sensors which can be tested using this device.
 3 Theusershould then connect the test sensor in the respective ports using
 jumper cables and then use the 2 navigation switches to choose the sensor
 which they want to test.
 4 Astheuser selects the sensor from the list using the SELECT switch, the
 device will run tests to check whether the sensor is working properly.
 5 Thedisplay will show up with a message informing the user about the
 working state of the test sensor.
