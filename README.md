# Arduino Sensor Tester

## Overview
The Arduino Sensor Tester is designed to simplify the process of testing various sensors, particularly in educational settings like the ECE Labs at IIITD. This plug-and-play solution saves time by providing a straightforward method to verify the functionality of different sensors without needing to set them up individually with an Arduino.

## Features
- Supports a wide range of sensors:
  - Bluetooth HC05
  - Current ACS712
  - DHT11 Temperature and Humidity
  - Force FSR402
  - Gas MQ135
  - IR
  - Gyro & Accelerometer MPU6050
  - PIR
  - Soil Moisture
  - Ultrasonic
- Easy to use with a simple interface and navigation buttons.
- Provides immediate feedback on the sensor's working state.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 9-12V DC Adapter for powering the device.
- Jumper cables for connecting sensors.

### Setup
1. **Power the device:** Connect the 9-12V DC adapter and turn on the power switch. The Green Power LED should light up.
2. **Initialization:** The LCD display will show a welcome message followed by a list of sensors that can be tested.
3. **Connect the sensor:** Use jumper cables to connect the test sensor to the respective ports.
4. **Select the sensor:** Use the navigation switches to choose the sensor you want to test from the list.
5. **Run the test:** Press the SELECT switch to run the tests. The device will display the result, informing you whether the sensor is working properly.
